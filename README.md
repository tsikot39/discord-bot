# Discord Weather Bot Project

The completed version of our Discord Weather Bot project for [Complete Node.js Developer: Zero to Mastery](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/a/aff_jqtq5631/external?affcode=441520_1jw4f2ay).

We recommend that you code along with us and use this only if you ever get stuck or you don't like to code along.

## Seting Up the Project

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. In the terminal, run: `npm install`
3. Sign up for a free Discord account, if you don't already have one.
4. Create a [Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) for your bot and find your application/client ID.
5. Create a Discord server to test your bot and find your server/guild ID.
6. Invite the bot to your Discord server.
7. Sign up for a free [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) account and find your API key.
8. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and populate it as below.

## Populating The Environment

In your `.env` file populate the following values:

```
